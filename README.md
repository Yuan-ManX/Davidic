Randomly generate musical scale, MIDI instrument(s), chord progression, and rhythm, then lock-in what you like and regenerate to refine.

Advanced controls: chord progressions and rhythms can be manually specified after selecting the Advanced Controls toggle, but UI support is minimal. Suggested usage is restricted to tweaking randomly-generated starting points.
